Melanoma is the most deadly skin cancer. According to the WHO, it is the cause of about 60,000 deaths per year worldwide. Early detection of melanoma is important to treat the disease as quickly as possible and remove the tumor by simple excision. Thus, obtaining a graphical interface capable of reading, segmenting and classifying dermoscopic images would be very useful to assist dermatologists in this difficult task.

This is a two-week project that I developed with six other classmates.
I did the segmentation with two other classmates.

I remain at your disposal for more information (cymoux on GitHub).
Please use Python 3 and Tkinter to create the GUI.

To make the code work, the tree structure of the data downloadable from the data folder must be as follows: 

    paf-dermoseg -> data -> ISIC-2017_Training_Data -> ISIC-2017_Training_Data
    paf-dermoseg -> Code


Run ui.py to launch the graphical GUI.
